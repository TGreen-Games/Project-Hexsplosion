# Project Hexsplosion
Hexsplosion is a simple competitive multiplayer strategy game primarily placed on mobile platforms and built for Google Play/IOS. The game combines active player interaction and area control and provides clear win conditions through point acquisition. 

## Installation

You can download the APK to your phone from the project itself or you can play it via Unity.

## Usage
Simplicity is the key feature, as Hexsplosion is easy to learn. You touch the screen to define a territory you wish to control, allow the reticle to expand to designate the size of that territory. Tap again to begin building that territory out. Theres also a tutorial to teach you the finer points of the game.
